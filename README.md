# Project 2: Stock Portfolio Management Web App

### A React-Flask full-stack web app with micro-services architecture
A Stock portfolio management system allows users to manage their stock portfolios, 
analyse the risk status of the current portfolios,
automatically monitor the status of the concerned stocks and get early warning, 
and analyse stocks to support investment in a single platform. 

Furthermore, we aim to implement a single page web application 
that separates the front-end and back-end
which can be deployed in the cloud using the docker micro-services architecture. 
In order to provide a good cross-platform experience,
modern Front-End framework and UI-library are applied.
Machine learning and deep learning methods such as LSTM 
are applied to predict the price and trend of a single stock,
and to analyse the profitability of the stock portfolio.
